## Session Update: 2025-09-21 - Critical DEX Routing Fixes COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### üéØ COMPLETED TASK: Comprehensive Mock Data & DEX Logic Updates

**Objective:** Fix critical DEX routing issues preventing proper large trade demonstrations for hackathon

**Issues Discovered & Resolved:**
1. **‚ùå ICDEX Threshold Bug**: Used raw token amounts (5 BTC) instead of USD values ($50K)
2. **‚ùå Outdated Price Data**: BTC at $97,600/$65,000 vs actual $115,474
3. **‚ùå Inconsistent Pricing**: 10+ files with different BTC/ETH/ICP prices
4. **‚ùå UI Slippage Disconnected**: User tolerance setting had no effect on routing

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Updated All Cryptocurrency Prices**: BTC $115,474, ETH $4,475, ICP $5.00 across 10 files
- ‚úÖ **Fixed ICDEX Threshold Logic**: Now shows for trades >$50K USD (was broken for large trades)
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Mock Data**: All pricing logic now uses current market rates
- ‚úÖ **USD-Based Calculations**: DEXRoutingAgent now properly converts token amounts to USD

**Files Updated (Comprehensive):**
- `master_asset_data.js/ts` - Core asset pricing data
- `dex_integration.js/ts` - DEX selection logic pricing
- `KongSwapAgent.ts, ICPSwapAgent.ts, ICDEXAgent.ts` - Individual DEX adapters
- `DEXRoutingAgent.js` - Core routing logic and calculations
- `test_dex_agent.js` - Test scenario calculations
- `types/dex.ts` - Exchange rates and conversion utilities

**Demo Impact:**
For $120K BTC ‚Üí USDC trade (hackathon demo scenario):
- ‚úÖ **ICDEX now appears** as "RECOMMENDED" (was completely missing)
- ‚úÖ **Realistic slippage calculations** based on current $115K BTC price
- ‚úÖ **Proper DEX comparison** demonstrates orderbook vs AMM advantages
- ‚úÖ **Consistent pricing** throughout application (no more $97K/65K inconsistencies)

**Compilation Status:** ‚úÖ Clean webpack build with all hot-reload updates successful

**Ready For:**
1. UI slippage tolerance business logic connection
2. Enhanced orderbook mock data for ICDEX demonstration
3. Final UX polish and hackathon deployment

**Planned Expansion Features:**

#### ReefRaffle - Daily NFT Lottery System
**Mechanism:**
- Daily NFT raffle ticket sales to users
- VRF Agent (Verifiable Random Function) for transparent random selection
- Built on Internet Computer's native VRF capabilities for cryptographic randomness
- Revenue from ticket sales funds prizes and system maintenance

**Technical Implementation:**
- VRF Agent: Utilizes IC's verifiable random function for ticket selection

#### Tsunami Sweep - Weekly Mega Lottery
**Mechanism:**
- Automatic entry of ALL daily tickets from complete week into mega raffle
- Larger prize pool aggregated from weekly ticket sales
- VRF Agent handles weekly draw with higher stakes
- Exact timeframe TBD (weekly cycle timing to be determined)

#### Revenue & Tokenomics Model
**Revenue Streams:**
- ReefRaffle daily ticket sales
- Tsunami Sweep automatic entries (funded by daily sales)
- Covers: Prize pools + Canister cycle fees + DAO treasury funding
- Integration with existing 0.1% swap fee structure

**DAO Integration:**
- All surplus revenue flows to HodlHut DAO treasury
- Community governance for prize pool distribution
- Lottery parameter management (ticket prices, draw frequency)
- Fund allocation between user rewards and protocol development

#### Technical Requirements (Future Development)
- **VRF Agent**: Core randomness infrastructure for fair lottery mechanics
- **NFT System**: Ticket minting and ownership tracking
- **Revenue Router**: Automated distribution between prizes, cycles, and DAO
- **Governance Interface**: DAO voting on lottery parameters and treasury usage

This gamification layer enhances My Garden's yield farming by adding lottery excitement while generating sustainable revenue for the protocol's continued development and user rewards.
